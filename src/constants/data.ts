    excerpt: "From class 11 fundamentals to mock-test mastery, here's the timeline our top rankers actually followed.",
    content:
      "Cracking NDA is less about hours and more about a calibrated calendar. We break the year into four 90-day blocks: foundation, depth, integration and simulation. In the foundation block, focus exclusively on NCERT mathematics (Class 11 + 12) and build a daily 30-minute current affairs habit using a single newspaper plus a monthly compendium. The depth block introduces sectional drills: trigonometry, vectors, 3D geometry, statistics. By the integration block (months 7–9), you should be attempting full GAT papers weekly. The final block is pure simulation — timed full-length papers under exam conditions, with detailed analytics after each. Pair the academic work with a non-negotiable physical regimen: 5 km run, push-ups, pull-ups, and a 30-minute swim weekly.",

    excerpt: "Beyond the buzzwords — how assessors actually evaluate effective intelligence, social adaptability and group influence.",
    content:
      "Officer Like Qualities (OLQs) are grouped into four factors: planning & organising, social adjustment, social effectiveness, and dynamic qualities. Most candidates parrot the 15 OLQs without understanding the underlying behaviour. Take 'Effective Intelligence' — it isn't IQ, it's the ability to find practical solutions under pressure. Or 'Liveliness' — it isn't being loud, it's bringing positive energy that lifts a group. The SSB is a 5-day continuous observation; every interaction with the wash-area orderly to your conduct in the dining hall is data. Train for OLQs the way you train for the written paper: deliberate, daily, measurable.",

    excerpt: "The dreaded PABT, decoded. Instrument battery, sensory motor apparatus and control velocity test explained.",
    content:
      "PABT is a one-shot test for flying branch aspirants. The Instrument Battery Test (IBT) checks your ability to read aircraft instruments and interpret aircraft position. The Sensory Motor Apparatus Test (SMAT) measures hand-eye-foot coordination under increasing complexity. The Control Velocity Test (CVT) tests anticipation and quick reactions. Practice with simulator apps is helpful but cannot replicate the cockpit-like setup at AFSB. Sleep well, eat light, and remember — PABT is pass/fail and only one attempt per lifetime.",

A structured 12-week plan: weeks 1–4 build aerobic base (3 km easy runs, 4x/week), weeks 5–8 introduce intervals and bodyweight strength (push-ups, pull-ups, planks), weeks 9–12 stack runs to 5 km at target pace and add obstacle simulation. Track everything. Sleep 7+ hours. Skip the supplements.",
